# Day 01

Given a file in which the first non-empty column contains the elements of list1 and the second non-empty column contains the elements of list2.


**Exercise 1**

Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.

Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.

Find the total distance between the left list and the right list by adding up the distances between all of the pairs you found.


**Exercise 2**

You'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.
