|---------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01      | Secret Entrance     | Low (5 mins) Simple list iteration.         | Low (10 mins) Maintains simple logic.          | Sliding Window: P1 was a direct comparison; P2 required comparing sums of a sliding window (triplets), slightly increasing index management complexity.                                                             |
| 02      | Invalid IDs         | Low (15 mins) String parsing & validation.  | Low-Medium (30 mins) String distance logic.    | Hamming Distance: P1 was checking rules; P2 required finding two strings that differed by exactly one character, requiring an $O(N^2)$ comparison or smart filtering.                                               |
| 03      | Battery (Joltage)   | Low (15 mins) Sorting & linear scan.        | Medium-High (45+ mins) Combinatorics/DP.       | The DP Trap: P1 was simple arithmetic on a sorted list. P2 asked for the total number of valid arrangements, which grew exponentially. Required Dynamic Programming or Memoization.                                 |
| 04      | Printing Department | Low-Medium (20 mins) Grid parsing & check.  | Medium (40 mins) Rule ordering logic.          | Topological Sort: P1 was verifying if an update was correct. P2 required fixing the incorrect ones, effectively forcing you to implement a custom sort based on the rules.                                          |
| 05      | Cafeteria           | Medium (30 mins) Direct mapping simulation. | High (2+ hours) Interval Arithmetic.           | The Scale Up: P1 used individual numbers. P2 switched to ranges of numbers (billions). Brute force simulation was impossible; required processing intersection/union of intervals.                                  |
| 06      | Columns             | Medium (30 mins) Guard movement sim.        | Medium-High (1.5 hours) Cycle detection.       | Time Loop: P1 was tracing a path. P2 required placing an obstacle to create a loop, forcing you to run the simulation thousands of times or optimize the "visited" state check (Position + Direction).              |
| 07      | Tachyon Beam        | Medium (40 mins) Beam propagation.          | High (1.5 hours) Max energy search.            | State Space: P1 was running the beam from one spot. P2 required running it from every possible edge tile to find the maximum. required optimizing the BFS/DFS to avoid redundant recalculations.                    |
| 08      | Junction Boxes      | Medium (45 mins) Path following (LCM).      | High (2+ hours) Chinese Remainder Thm.         | Math Trick: P1 was a simple cycle count. P2 ghost-walked multiple nodes simultaneously. The answer was too large to simulate; required realizing the cycles were independent and using Least Common Multiple (LCM). |
| 09      | Disk Fragmenter     | Medium-High (1 hour) Two-pointer swap.      | High (3 hours) Knapsack-style fitting.         | Contiguous Blocks: P1 moved individual blocks (easy two-pointer). P2 required moving whole files into the first available slot large enough, necessitating a robust free-space management system.                   |
| 10      | Hoof It             | Medium (1 hour) BFS/DFS Reachability.       | Medium (1 hour) Distinct Path Counting.        | Rating vs. Score: P1 counted reachable endpoints (Set). P2 counted distinct paths to endpoints (Sum). Surprisingly, P2 was often easier if you implemented P1 recursively, as you just removed the "visited" check. |
| 11      | Plutonian Pebbles   | Low (20 mins) Simulation (25 steps).        | Very High (4+ hours) DP/Counter (75 steps).    | Exponential Growth: P1 was solvable with a list. P2 ran for 75 steps, creating trillions of items. Required abandoning the list for a Map<Value, Count> frequency counter approach.                                 |
| 12      | Garden Groups       | Medium (1 hour) Flood fill (Area/Perim).    | Very High (4+ hours) Geometry (Sides/Corners). | Geometric Complexity: P1 used Area × Perimeter. P2 used Area × Number of Sides. Counting sides/corners on a grid shape is significantly harder than counting perimeter edges.                                       |
